The competition is held in the Huashan Mountain, Shaanxi Province. The 2023 Huashan UAV Challenge is the first time that the competition has been held. This competition requires two drones to bypass the threat area in the field and reach the target point simultaneously. The drones get their positions using UWB.\nMy Role I led a team of six students. I contirbuted to the system architecture of the drones, including the hardware and software. I provided a framework to achieve UWB positioning, communication between the drones and the ground station, trajectory planning, and tracking control based on ROS and PX4.\n▲ First meeting of the team. I was sharing my ideas about the hardware architecture of the drones.\n▲ The last night before the competition. We were testing the drones all night.\n▲ One moment during the competition. The drones were flying to the target point.\nHighlights ▲ The certificate of the 1st place in the 2023 Huashan UAV Challenge.\n▲ The drones were exhibited in the 2023 Beihang University Technology Exhibition.\n","date":1687219200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687219200,"objectID":"79e61456810715fc17143c147c928636","permalink":"https://yichengchen.com/project/huashan_uav_challenge/","publishdate":"2023-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/huashan_uav_challenge/","section":"project","summary":"led a team to win the 1st place in the 2023 Huashan UAV Challenge.","tags":[],"title":"2023 Huashan UAV Challenge - Champion","type":"project"},{"authors":["Yicheng Chen","Lingling Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"At the conference CACRE 2022, I was honored the Best Presenter Award for an excellent oral presentation.\n","date":1657929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657929600,"objectID":"cb2e4a1b5e76f37df212986df4be1980","permalink":"https://yichengchen.com/publication/adrrt_star/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/adrrt_star/","section":"publication","summary":"An RRT-based path planning algorithm enables UAVs to replan safe paths when dynamic threats emerge.","tags":[],"title":"Adaptively Dynamic RRT*-Connect: Path Planning for UAVs Against Dynamic Obstacles","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"I have implemented some basic SLAM algorithms on unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) including a TurtleBot and an Ackerman mini vehicle.\nTurtleBot I have implemented G-mapping on the TurtleBot.\n▲ Running G-mapping on the TurtleBot\n▲ The map generated by G-mapping\nAckerman mini vehicle I have implemented Gmapping and RTAB-Map on the Ackerman mini vehicle.
