That’s it, this project is started! Project objectives This project aims to address the issue: How to enable agile flight for aerial robotics swarm in complex environments? The main considerations of this projects include:\nFull autonomy: Fully onboard perception, localization, planning, and control. Online: Real-time flying in unknown environments. Cooperation: Multiple drones to perform cooperative tasks, such as search and rescue. Roadmap WP1: Trajectory parameterization\nParameterize trajectories in a spatial-temporal-decoupled form to support independent optimization on the spatial and temporal profile of the trajectory.\nWP2: Distributed trajectory planning\nBuild an optimization framework considering control effort, execution time, dynamic feasibility, obstacle avoidance, and swarm reciprocal avoidance. And use gradient-based solvers to solve the problem.\nWP3: Real-world experiments\nBuild quadrotors equipped with depth cameras, Intel NUC, and the Pixhawk controller to conduct real-world experiments.\n","date":1668124800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668124800,"objectID":"57dfd8517a0a70434e1453262850c81d","permalink":"https://amos-chen98.github.io/project/master_thesis/","publishdate":"2022-11-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/master_thesis/","section":"project","summary":"**Master's thesis (ongoing)** | This project tries to answer this question: How to navigate an aerial robotics swarm with autonomy, safety, and agility in complex environments?","tags":[],"title":"Cooperative Online Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Aerial Robotics Swarm","type":"project"},{"authors":["Yicheng Chen","Lingling Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"At the conference CACRE 2022, I was honored the Best Presenter Award for an excellent oral presentation.\n","date":1657929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657929600,"objectID":"69e52e3b153ab4fdb7d78da8f2cdcd0d","permalink":"https://amos-chen98.github.io/publication/bachelor_thesis/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bachelor_thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"An RRT-based path planning algorithm enables UAVs to replan safe paths when dynamic threats emerge.","tags":[],"title":"Adaptively Dynamic RRT*-Connect: Path Planning for UAVs Against Dynamic Obstacles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huan Chang","Yicheng Chen","Baochang Zhang","David Doermann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1623110400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623110400,"objectID":"44baac65b5d2bab0e7a0ac34b212f8ce","permalink":"https://amos-chen98.github.io/publication/mec/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mec/","section":"publication","summary":"A novel multi-UAV mobile edge computing framework, aiming to provide better Quality-of-Service and path planning based on reinforcement learning.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-UAV Mobile Edge Computing and Path Planning Platform Based on Reinforcement Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Aim Use machine learning approaches to help preliminary diagnosis of chest radiographs: classify radiographs into 3 classes – COVID, normal, and viral pneumonia with the highest possible accuracy.\nMethod Used transfer learning to train several models including ResNet, DenseNet, InceptionResNet, etc. on a labeled training set.
