The competition is held in the Huashan Mountain, Shaanxi Province. The 2023 Huashan UAV Challenge is the first time that the competition has been held. This competition requires two drones to bypass the threat area in the field and reach the target point simultaneously. The drones get their positions using UWB.\nMy Role I led a team of six students. I contirbuted to the system architecture of the drones, including the hardware and software. I provided a framework to achieve UWB positioning, communication between the drones and the ground station, trajectory planning, and tracking control based on ROS and PX4.\n▲ First meeting of the team.
